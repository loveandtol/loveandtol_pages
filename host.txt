GENERAL SCRIPT

Welcome to the very open Love and Tolerance meeting of Alcoholics
Anonymous. My name is _____ and I am an Alcoholic. I’ll be your
chairperson this evening.

Please help me open the meeting with the Serenity Prayer.

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage
to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.

We will be placing everyone on mute for the duration of the meeting. If
you want to share please use the raise your hand feature and I will
unmute you. The instructions on how to share will be posted in the chat.

AA PREAMBLE

Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of people who share their
experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their
common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only
requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no
dues or fees for AA membership; we are self-supporting through our own
contributions. AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics,
organization, or institution; does not wish to engage in any
controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary
purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.

I have asked ______ [a friend] to read “How it Works” from page 58 of
the Big Book.

I have asked ________ [another friend] to read Step 10 and part of its
promises, from page 84 of the Big Book.

Are there any AA-related announcements?

Is there anyone here counting days, weeks, or months?

Are there any anniversaries?

There are no dues or fees, but we do have expenses. In keeping with the
7th tradition, you may contribute via Venmo, Cash.app, Zelle, or check.

Tonight, is a discussion meeting, on a topic from AA approved
literature.

I have asked _________ to choose a reading.

  Chair introduces another attendee who was invited to choose a reading
  from AA approved literature and then the reader shares their
  experience, strength, and hope

We are open for discussion. Please limit your comments to 3 minutes and
share only once so that everyone may have a chance to share. We will be
setting a timer and will remind you when there is “one minute” left,
after that I’ll ask you to wrap it up. Please don’t take this
personally.

Directions to raise a virtual hand are posted in the chat, you can also
message me or a co-host, or wave on video. Please let’s have a safe and
clean meeting!

  DURING ANY PAUSES IN THE MEETING:

  Remind people they can share about anything on their mind, or just
  introduce themselves if they’re new to our group.

  Moments of silence do not reflect badly on the topic or the
  chairperson, see it as time to process.

  AND PRIVATELY.

The Chat is now open. Please keep it clean, respectful, and safe. When
someone reaches out, know that you DO NOT have to give your number if
you feel uncomfortable. Our PRIMARY purpose is to stay sober and help
other alcoholics achieve sobriety. If you feel that someone is being
inappropriate, please reach out to the Host or a Co-Host.

DECLARATION PLEDGE:

When anyone, anywhere, reaches out for help, I want the hand of AA
always to be there. And for that: I am responsible.

Just a reminder, Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of our program.
If we are to recover, we must feel free to say what is in our minds and
hearts. Therefore, who you see here, what you hear here, when you leave
here, let it stay here.

Please stay after the meeting for more fellowship.

Please help me close the meeting with the “We” version of the serenity
prayer.

God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change; courage
to change the things we can; and wisdom to know the difference.
