Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty.</description></item><item><title>10th Step and Part of its Promises</title><link>https://loveandtol.com/meeting/tenth-step-promises/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 15:16:33 -0500</pubDate><author>loveandtolerancezoom@gmail.com (Love and Tolerance Online)</author><guid>https://loveandtol.com/meeting/tenth-step-promises/</guid><description>Big Book, pg. 84 Full text »
This thought brings us to Step Ten, which suggests we continue to take personal inventory and continue to set right any new mistakes as we go along. We vigorously commenced this way of living as we cleaned up the past. We have entered the world of the Spirit. Our next function is to grow in understanding and effectiveness. This is not an overnight matter.</description></item><item><title>How to Donate</title><link>https://loveandtol.com/meeting/donations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 15:19:51 -0500</pubDate><author>loveandtolerancezoom@gmail.com (Love and Tolerance Online)</author><guid>https://loveandtol.com/meeting/donations/</guid><description>There are no dues or fees, but we do have expenses.
