*** CO-HOST SCRIPT PREREQUISTES ***

This is the General script for the Co-Host.

-   This script contains all CO- HOST related material a meeting.
-   It is very important that the Host and a Co-Host be in regular
    communication, and that expectations are discussed between them
    (e.g., Coordination of topic, who is timing)

From the AA Zoom Security Guide (Hardware suggestions)

-   ADMINS, HOSTS AND CO-HOSTS SHOULD NOT BE ON A MOBILE DEVICE WHEN
    RUNNING A MEETING. USE A FULL PC OR FAIRLY DECENT LAPTOP.
-   Zoom doesn’t have the same features, easily accessible on mobile
    devices.
-   It is highly recommended:
    -   At minimum, use a laptop or a desktop computer, running Windows,
        MacOS or Linux.
    -   Use an external mouse. This enhances the ability to react
        quickly to disruptors.
    -   Use of a secondary/external monitor is preferred but not
        required.

Responsibilities of the Co-Host

-   IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE CO-HOST BE THE ONLY ONE THAT ADMIT ANY ATTENDEES FROM THE WAITING ROOM. By performing this task, the co-host(s) will be aware of everyone that has been admitted.

-   The co-host performs all activities and configuration changes to
    ensure the meeting is as safe as possible.

-   Transfer “Host” duties to the Host once they join. If they are
    already present, request that they make you a “Co-Host.”

-   It is best to enlist the assistance of another qualified attendee
    and ask the Host to make them a co-host.

-   Coordinate with the host who will be doing the timing. Use a
    3-minute timer, giving the sharer a 1-minute warning. After that
    minute kindly tell them to wrap it up.

-   YOU MUST remain focused on the meeting for the entire meeting, fully
    engaged and monitoring for potential issues.

-   Prior to the meeting, ensure the following pre-meeting settings are
    configure:
