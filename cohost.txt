  This is the Co-Host script, used by the Co-Host for all Copy and
  Pasting material into the chat, during a meeting. Doing this, the Host
  will be able to focus on facilitating the meeting. We suggest that
  regular communication and expectations be discussed between the Host
  and Co-Host.

  REMINDERs:

  AT 10PM ENSURE THE FOLLOWING CONFIGURATIONS * Mute All participants. *
  “Mute Participants upon Entry” is checked. * “Allow Participants to
  Unmute Themselves” is unchecked. * “Host and co-hosts” should be
  selected in “Participant Can Chat with:”

Keep an eye on the waiting room and admit people. Let the host mute and
unmute people unless a zoom bomber goes off. Then mute the bomber
quickly & turn their camera off. After that just leave them and look for
the next one. Only post items that are in bold.

Post in chat at these times.
