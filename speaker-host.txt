  This is the Speaker Meeting script for the Host. It contains all HOST
  related material for a meeting. The Co-Host script is intended to be
  used by the Co-Host for all Copy and Pasting material into the chat,
  during a meeting. If the Co-Host is doing that, this is all you will
  need, to facilitate the meeting. If there is no Co-Host, the Co-Host
  script will be necessary as well. It is suggested that there be a Host
  and a Co-Host and regular communication, and expectations are
  discussed between them.

  REMINDERs:

  AT 10PM ENSURE THE FOLLOWING CONFIGURATIONS

  -   Mute All participants.
  -   Mute Participants upon Entry is checked.
  -   Allow Participants to Unmute Themselves is unchecked.
  -   “Host and co-hosts” should be selected in “Participant Can Chat
      with:”

SPEAKER MEETING SCRIPT

Welcome to the very open Love and Tolerance meeting of Alcoholics
Anonymous. My name is _____ and I am an Alcoholic. I’ll be your
chairperson this evening.

Please help me open the meeting with the Serenity Prayer.

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage
to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.

We will be placing everyone on mute for the duration of the meeting. If
you want to share please use the raise your hand feature and I will
unmute you. The instructions on how to share will be posted in the chat.

AA PREAMBLE

Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of people who share their
experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their
common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only
requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no
dues or fees for AA membership; we are self-supporting through our own
contributions. AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics,
organization, or institution; does not wish to engage in any
controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary
purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.

I have asked ______ [a friend] to read “How it Works” from page 58 of
the Big Book.

I have asked ________ [another friend] to read Step 10 and part of its
promises, from page 84 of the Big Book.

Are there any AA-related announcements?

Is there anyone here counting days, weeks, or months?

Are there any anniversaries?

There are no dues or fees, but we do have expenses. In keeping with the
7th tradition, a Venmo ID to contribute will be posted in the chat. The
Venmo ID for making donations is @LOVEANDTOLERANCE. The Venmo QR will be
shared in the meeting chat as well for convenience. Our account is
associated with the name, Jess T. Please contact a host or co-host after
the meeting if you have questions on how to donate.

Tonight’s meeting is a speaker discussion. Our speaker will share their
experience, strength, and hope for about 25 minutes and then the floor
will be open for sharing. After, we will open for sharing. Please limit
your comments to 3 mins and share only once so that everyone may have a
chance to share. We will be setting a timer and will remind you there is
“one minute” left. Please don’t take it personally.

  Once speaker is finished after 25 minutes

We are open for discussion. Please limit your comments to 3 minutes and
share only once so that everyone may have a chance to share. We will be
setting a timer and will remind you when there is “one minute” left,
after that I’ll ask you to wrap it up. Please don’t take this
personally.

Directions to raise a virtual hand are posted in the chat, you can also
message me or a co-host, or wave on video. Please let’s have a safe and
clean meeting!

  DURING ANY PAUSES IN THE MEETING:

  Remind people they can share about anything on their mind, or just
  introduce themselves if they’re new to our group.

  Moments of silence do not reflect badly on the topic or the
  chairperson, see it as time to process.

  AT 10:45 pm YOU CAN ENABLE THE CHAT FEATURE AGAIN TO EVERYONE PUBLICLY
  AND PRIVATELY.

The Chat is now open. Please keep it clean, respectful, and safe. When
someone reaches out, know that you DO NOT have to give your number if
you feel uncomfortable. Our PRIMARY purpose is to stay sober and help
other alcoholics achieve sobriety. If you feel that someone is being
inappropriate, please reach out to the Host or a Co-Host.

  AT 10:55/11 pm prepare to close the meeting

We are out of time. I would like to thank __________ for sharing their
experience, strength, and hope with us tonight. Please join us for
fellowship after the meeting and come back tomorrow. Just a reminder
that we meet 7 nights a week at 10 pm Eastern, at the same time, same
meeting access code.

If you are interested in becoming a homegroup member, would like to Host
or Co-Host for the next rotation or need a Big Book or other AA approved
literature please send an email to info@loveandtol.com.

If you would like to be included in the Love & Tolerance contact list or
would like to receive a contact list, please send an email to
info@loveandtol.com.

Here at Love and Tolerance, we believe sponsorship is important for our
recovery. A sponsor is someone to help you through the 12 Steps of
Alcoholics Anonymous. IF YOU ARE ACTIVELY WORKING THE 12 STEPS AND are
available to sponsor, please put your contact info in the chat now. If
you need a sponsor or have any questions, please reach out to one of
these people.

If you need proof of meeting attendance, please email
info@loveandtol.com.

Find all this information and more at our website, www.loveandtol.com

If you are in a place where you can’t have a phone, please make note of
our meeting code so you can sign on when you get home, and we can help
each other stay sober.

  Love and Tolerance Meeting Code 190-210-132

DECLARATION PLEDGE:

When anyone, anywhere, reaches out for help, I want the hand of AA
always to be there. And for that: I am responsible.

Just a reminder, Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of our program.
If we are to recover, we must feel free to say what is in our minds and
hearts. Therefore, who you see here, what you hear here, when you leave
here, let it stay here.

Please stay after the meeting for more fellowship.

Please help me close the meeting with the “We” version of the serenity
prayer.

God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change; courage
to change the things we can; and wisdom to know the difference.
